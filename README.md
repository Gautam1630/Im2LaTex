# Im2Latex
This is an attempt to solve the Open AI problem for conversion of images contating formulas to their Latex code. The architechture of our model is inpired from [Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning]https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03122 and [What You Get Is What You See:
A Visual Markup Decompiler]https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04938v1.pdf. We used im2latex-100k dataset available [here]https://zenodo.org/record/56198#.W9QISnUzZuQ.
